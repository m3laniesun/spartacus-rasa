      Welcome to the future of aviation. This is step 1 in the Flight to the Future program.

      At the completion of this step, you will become an FAA licensed commercial drone pilot.

      From understanding how drones are made to the rules of operating them in the National Airspace, you’ll learn about topics
      that will help you pass the FAA Part 107 exam for drone pilots.

      Drone systems

      What are drones? From multi-rotors to fixed-wing, drones come in many shapes and sizes. 
      In this lesson you’ll learn how drones are made, what their vital components are, and the engineering that makes it all possible.

      With emphasis on multi-rotors, you’ll get a good understanding of the vital systems and technologies employed.
      For additional perspective, delve into the history of drones and discover how this technological marvel evolved.

      Drones, UAVs and UAS

      Drones in general describe machines that have some level of independence and can operate without human intervention or assistance
      for periods of time. To get a deeper understanding of drones and drone systems, we have to start by defining them. 
      
      Although unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs have become synonymous with the word drones, a large variety of machines can fall under this category.
      
      As a future unmanned aerial services or UAS provider, you should have a good grasp of the concepts and technologies that converge in engineering
      and operating drones.

  utter_module_1_2_4:

      Technologies transforming the industry

      Then there is the autonomous capability – or at least some degree of automated operations that are a universal characteristic of all drones.
      
      From the perspective of a commercial drone operator, the industry is changing rapidly. Many of the core technologies are rapidly
      evolving – enabling new, innovative solutions and business models.

      This lesson will introduce you to some of those technologies, notably cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
      With the advent of wireless connectivity, these technologies are transforming how unmanned aerial missions are planned and executed.
      
      You’ll learn the difference between active and passive drone missions and how sensors and payloads define capabilities. 
      And despite the versatile nature of these capabilities, specialized industry solutions have emerged and are rapidly evolving. 
      
      As a future UAS provider, you need to be keenly aware of the trends and future directions.

      Cloud connected VTOL drone with specialized sensors, LTE communications and AI based video analysis
      Regulations and policies

      Rapid expansion of this industry requires a deep integration of UAV services into the National Airspace System or NAS. 
      The Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, was initially slow in taking steps to do this.
      
      However, since 2016 they have ramped up their efforts to provide regulatory oversight on UAV operations.
      You’ll get a good introduction to the current picture, preparing you for a deeper dive in subsequent lessons.

  utter_module_1_2_6:

      Drone systems
      
      A drone system will consist of an Air Segment and Ground Segment. The Air Segment includes everything that flies to perform a mission.
      Namely the UAV and a payload. 
      
      The Ground Segment includes the technology that is fixed to the ground and manages the UAV from mission planning
      to completion including post mission reporting. Drone engineering is focused on the air segment of the system.


  utter_module_1_2_7:

      Drone engineering and electronics
      
      Next, we’ll turn attention to the vehicle itself – the unmanned aerial vehicle.
      
      There are two basic configurations: fixed wing and VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing).
      The focus in our curriculum, will be on VTOL versions.
      
      Additionally, as you’ll see later, current regulations usually don’t permit BVLOS (beyond visual line of sight) operations.
      
      So the main choice of propulsion becomes battery power, which is increasingly suitable for short flights.
      Information on gas powered engines and hybrid configurations can be found in the lesson bibliography.
      
      The key electronic components in a VTOL are a transceiver, a flight controller and a regulator-distributor.
      Integrated with these, are the drone motors and the battery of course. 
      
      As you’ll discover later, mission specifics can influence the exact nature of the technical capabilities. 

      For example, a GPS card is an option that can be added for enhanced flight control if the selected flight controller can leverage
      GPS for autonomous navigation.
      
      A transceiver receives and sends control data as well as payload data between the UAV and the ground segment.

      So, if the UAV is only flown by a direct radio frequency (RF) hand controller, then it only needs an RF transceiver. 
      
      An LTE (Long-Term Evolution) or satellite transceiver is needed if the UAV is used for longer distance missions.

      Take a deeper dive on these topics in the concept section of this lesson.

      Sensors and payloads
      
      Sensors vary based on mission requirements and vehicle capability. Full spectrum observational sensors are available.
      
      Additionally, specialized equipment such as LIDAR (using lasers) is increasingly in use. Fire and radiation detection sensors 
      are amongst some of the most advanced capabilities being developed for commercial use.

      Payloads are the next evolution in commercial drone operations. 
      Due to power constraints, UAVs are often built around specific payloads. 
      
      For example, medical delivery requirements may require a refrigerated payload to be maintained during transport. 
      Nevertheless, more generalized capabilities are being devised to enable drones to perform multiple types of missions.

      Finally, a bit of history

      Drones, specifically the aerial variety, have been evolving for over a century now. Their origins are in warfare and military applications.
      
      To understand how the age of commercial drones appeared in the past couple of decades, its essential to understand the milestones that preceded.

      We’ll look at how drones first made their appearance as aerial bombs, then moved on to become radio-controlled targets 
      for anti-aircraft defense training.
      They eventually became jet powered and could be used for high altitude reconnaissance missions. 
      
      Finally, in the last decade of the Twentieth Century, their use in military expanded rapidly, laying the groundwork for commercial versions 
      to make their way into the market.

      With over a century of military development, drones start appearing in the commercial sector. It begins with government agencies looking into drone use for emergency response and disaster management.
      By 2006, the FAA issues its first commercial drone license. A surge in private sector applications begins, with a preference for multi-rotors due to (still in place) restrictions on beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) operations.
